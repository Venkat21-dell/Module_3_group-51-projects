## REMOTE KEYLESS ENTRY
## DESCRIPTION
Remote keyless entry (RKE) system is a system designed to remotely lock or unlock access to automobiles. Over 70% of the vehicles made today come with a remote keyless entry (RKE) system either standard or as an option. RKE systems are also a high volume after-market accessory. Most remote keyless entry systems alarm the vehicle against theft and lock and unlock the doors and trunk. Some include remote start and car finder functions.
Remote keyless systems consist of a key fob transmitter and a receiver inside the vehicle.
Remote Key Entry is an electronic lock that controls access to a building or vehicle without using a conventional mechanical key.
The term Remote Key entry system literally means controlled some functionality of car by a remote such as lock, unlock, alarm activation and approch light at or near the car, which requires entering a default (or self-programmed) numeric code. 
RKE transmission requires two components - a transmitter and a receiver. 
Transmitter - RKE key fob, other ID device with RKE integrated Receiver - Body Control ECU, other ECU with integrated RKE. 
RKE operates by broadcasting radio waves on a particular frequency unidirectionally. 
RKE systems implement encryption and rolling code algorithms to prevent car thieves from intercepting and spoofing the telegrams.
